# LDA-linear-descriminant-analysis-
The LDA algorithm starts by finding directions that maximize the separation between classes, then use these directions to predict the class of individuals. These directions, called linear discriminants, are a linear combinations of predictor variables.  LDA assumes that predictors are normally distributed (Gaussian distribution) and that the different classes have class-specific means and equal variance/covariance.
